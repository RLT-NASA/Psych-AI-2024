Several studies\\nidentified some possible hazards of space travels and related physical and psychological\\nconsequences on astronauts. If some psychological reactions are obviously inherent to the\\ncharacteristics of the spaceships (habitability, confinement, psychological, and interpersonal\\nrelationships), other (disturbances of sleep-wake cycle, personality changes, depression, anxiety,\\napathy, psychosomatic symptoms, neurovestibular problems, alterations in cognitive function,\\nand sensory perception) represent a clear warning of possible central nervous system (CNS)\\nalterations, possibly due to microgravity and cosmic radiation. Such conditions and eventual\\nCNS changes might compromise the success of missions and the ability to cope with unexpected\\nevents and may lead to individual and long-term impairments. Therefore, further studies are\\nneeded, perhaps, requiring the birth of a novel branch of psychology/psychiatry that should not\\nonly consider the risks related to space exploration, but the implementation of targeted\\nstrategies to prevent them.\\nIntroduction\\nThe history of human beings is accompanied by a constant drive to overcome the limits\\nintrinsic to their nature, like the possibility to fly. As such, it is paved by continuous attempts\\nto accomplish this goal throughout the millennia, from the Icarus’ myth to the flying\\nmachines of Da Vinci until the first airplane built by Wright brothers. The 20th century\\nwas a unique century for the extraordinary developments of flying aircrafts for both war and\\ncivil use, as well as for the beginning of space exploration that started in 1944 with the V2\\nrocket. The soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first man to be launched into the space on\\nthe 12th of April 1961, a date that gave birth to the space race.1Soviet Union was soon\\nfollowed by the United States with the renowned Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs that\\nled Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to land on the Moon. Different dates in the following\\nyears mark some relevant milestones in the history of space missions, important for present\\nand future space travels. In 1970, the U.S. Apollo 13 mission aimed to land on the Moon for\\nthe third time, but during the trip, the spacecraft was damaged and the purpose of the mission\\nwas to bring the three astronauts back. In 1971, the USSR launched its first space station,\\nSalyut-1, as a short-lived space laboratory that laid the foundations for subsequent stations\\nand medical investigations of astronauts, followed by the U.S. first space station, Skylab, a top\\nof a Saturn V rocket, in 1973. This served as a solar and terrestrial observatory and as a\\nmicrogravity and medical laboratory.2 In 1981, the shuttle Columbia orbiter left its pad at\\nKennedy space center during the transportation system (STS-1) mission, while heraldeing the\\nbeginning of a new era of spaceships that could be reused.3 The next STS missions played an\\nimportant role in implementing biological studies.4 The base block of MIR, a Soviet modular\\nspace station, was put in orbit in 1986 and about a month later was joined by its first crew.\\nAlthough it served primarily as a test for space hardware, more than 100 astronauts from\\ndifferent nations carried out extensive scientific research, especially on the effects of micro-\\ngravity on living organisms.5 The two nations ended up forming a successful collaboration\\nover the years that still continues on the international space station (ISS) that represents a\\nunique environment for the study of long-term space missions.\\nSeveral countries have then rapidly shown a keen interest in space missions, so that the\\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in collaboration with space agencies\\nfrom all over the world, is currently planning the Artemis program that is the return of men to the\\nMoon and, in particular, of the first woman.

These can be grouped in\\nphysical, habitability factors, and individual or interpersonal psy-\\nchological factors, and will be briefly reviewed herein.14,15\\nPhysical factors\\nMicrogravity, radiation, and habitability stand among the most\\nstudied physical parameters with evidence of their potentially\\nnegative consequences.\\nMicrogravity\\nAlthough the full effects of microgravity on human physiology are\\nstill unclear and mainly derived from simulation studies, evidence\\nsuggests that it might impact cell structure and differentiation, and\\nboth the immune and central nervous system (CNS).16,17 Indeed,\\nthe CNS needs to adapt to microgravity since different somatosen-\\nsory, visual, and vestibular informations have to be elaborated.18 A\\nsyndrome known as space adaptation syndrome may occur as a\\nconsequence of a sensory conflict between inputs from visual and\\ntactile senses and vestibular organs.19 Furthermore, microgravity\\ncan lead to some changes in cognitive functioning, as demonstrated\\nby a reduction in some motor functions (ie, dual-tasking, motion\\nperception, and manual dexterity) in a small sample of eight\\nastronauts following a 6-month period spent on ISS that, however,\\ndisappeared four days after landing.20\\nRadiation\\nThere is now a general agreement that space radiation represents a\\nfurther risk during space missions and, interestingly, NASA shows\\na huge concern on this matter.21 The global radiation dose for\\nastronauts is deeply affected by galactic cosmic rays (GCR) origi-\\nnating from outside the solar system and including alpha particles,\\nprotons, and high-energy, heavier nuclei components of the former\\nthat are called high atomic number and energy (HZE).22,23 As GCR\\ninteract with the shielding material of a space shuttle, a large\\nemission of secondary neutrons may follow, thus potentially\\nimpinging on the bodies of cosmonauts.24 Furthermore, pulses of\\nheavy ion and energetic proton radiation may be the result of solar\\nparticle events, including coronal mass ejections and solar flares.25\\nAlong with electromagnetic field and weightlessness, radiation may\\nlead to several CNS changes, such as shifts in brain fluids, altered\\nsensory perception, and neurovestibular problems.26 Data from\\nrodent models reported modifications of the CA1 superficial layer\\npyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, that may persist\\nafter 6 months from the irradiation.27 This caused learning and\\nmemory impairment, as well as increased anxiety behaviors also\\nindicating damage of the amygdala and of some cortical neu-\\nrons.28,29 Moreover, astronauts may undergo deficits in executive\\nfunctions and decision-making due to a functional loss in the\\nmedial prefrontal cortex, posterior and anterior cingulate, and\\nbasal forebrain.27,30 Indeed, it is a common assumption that one\\nout of five astronauts taking part in a long space mission would\\nexperience similar behaviors, and out of three would instead face\\nstruggles in memory processes.27 Radiation exposure may also be\\none of the determinants of visual disturbances. During the Apollo,\\nSkylab, and MIR missions, astronauts observed flashes of light, of\\ndifferent shapes, moving across the visual field.31 Such flashes were\\nmore often present before sleep, predominantly white, with elon-\\ngated shapes and often accompanied by senses of movement\\nperceived as lateral, diagonal or in-out.32 It has been suggested that\\nthese phosphenes can be a consequence of an alteration in percep-\\ntion caused by ionizing radiation on the eye.33\\nHabitability\\nSeveral factors of “habitability”, a term used with reference to the\\nmain characteristics of the spacecraft, may contribute to the overall\\nwell-being of astronauts, while including light, noise, vibration, and\\ntemperature.15,34 The light represents the main stimulus of the\\ncircadian rhythms that can be deeply affected by changes in lumi-\\nnosity. Therefore, it has been suggested to remove the light from the\\nsettings and the spaces dedicated to sleep, or to create an environ-\\nment with alternating light and dark in the spaces shared by the\\nastronauts.35 Excessive exposure to noise, mainly due to the equip-\\nment and the crew activities, may represent another stressor\\ncompromising wakefulness and sleeping, so that cosmonauts have\\nbeen instructed to wear protection devices.36\\nWhole-body vibration may represent another harmful factor\\ndue to the risk of spinal and extremity injuries.37 Finally, habitabil-\\nity includes the need for privacy that may not be always sufficiently\\nrespected.38\\nPsychological factors\\nThe peculiarities of life during long space missions, specifically\\nisolation and interpersonal relationships may represent stressors\\nleading to psychological/psychosocial problems or even to psycho-\\npathological symptoms or disorders.\\nIndividual issues\\nIsolation from family, friends, and the life on the Earth, coupled\\nwith hard work continuously monitored, represent some factors of\\npotential psychological distress.13 During isolation, memory and\\nconcentration deficits may occur, along with an increase in the\\nlikelihood of making errors and a decrease in reaction times.39 Long\\nspace missions can also induce cosmonauts to monotony that may\\nworsen other psychological stressors, thus potentially leading to\\nimpaired performance and behaviors.40 Furthermore, since crew\\nactivities become progressively part of a routine, an increase in free\\ntime and a greater likelihood of asthenia, withdrawal, and territo-\\nrial behavior may follow.41\\nInterpersonal issues\\nDuring a space mission, the mental well-being of an astronaut can\\nbe affected by factors related to the relationships with other crew\\nmembers, especially when they are heterogeneous. These may\\nprovoke tension, loosening of the team cohesion, subgrouping,\\nscapegoating, communication issues, the creation of a competitive\\nenvironment and uncertainty regarding individual roles.7 The\\nrelationships between cosmonauts and ground control are also\\nimportant, as conflicts may arise for disparate reasons, such as\\ndelays in communication, ranging from minimal delays to around\\n24 minutes from the most distant planets, caused by the distance\\nfrom Earth.42,43\\nPsychopathological issues\\nThe presence of loss of or reduced sleep quality is a critical issue\\namong astronauts, as it may provoke fatigue, concentration\\nCNS Spectrums\\n537\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1092852921000535 Published online by Cambridge University Press\\nproblems and possible drop in overall performance levels leading\\nto potentially damaging errors.44,45 The duration of astronauts’\\nsleep seems to be reduced to around 6 to 6.5 hours/day during\\nmissions,46–48 in parallel with a decreased amount of both slow-\\nwave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and a shortening of\\nREM latency.46 The impact of sleep is highlighted by the results of\\na ground-based simulation of a mission to Mars involving six\\nindividuals isolated for 520 days. Most subjects experienced\\nrecurrent reductions in perceived sleep quality, interrupted\\nsleep–wake periodicity, performance deficits associated with\\nchronic partial sleep deprivation, and increased sleep displace-\\nment in the daytime period.49 Not surprisingly, the use of hyp-\\nnotics during flight is common, as demonstrated in a study on the\\ncrew of a shuttle50: approximately three quarters of the crew\\nreported taking hypnotics, mainly zolpidem and its extended-\\nrelease formulation or temazepam.51,52 Although, while compar-\\ning nights with and without a sleeping pill, no difference was\\npresent in total sleep time and night-time alertness, significant\\ndifferences were found in sleep efficiency, latency and, albeit\\nslightly, subjective quality.50\\nIt has been hypothesized that extreme environments, like the\\nspace, despite their diversity, are a similar potential threat to\\nmental conditions, and specific factors have been proposed that\\ncould play a role in the occurrence of psychological and psychic\\nproblems among astronauts. A review of data on Arctic confine-\\nment showed that personality traits, coping styles, and interper-\\nsonal needs are important predictors of depressed mood.53\\nDuring space missions, prolonged and severe isolation seems to\\ncorrelate with the onset of reduced resilience, apathy, boredom,\\ndepression, anxiety, and declines in initiative, general activity\\nand desire.54,55 Several psychosomatic symptoms have been also\\ndescribed among astronauts during missions, such as headaches,\\ngastroenteric problems, genitourinary symptoms, and fear of\\nillness.56–58 The issue of asthenia as a problematic syndrome\\nduring space missions is quite common, but still unresolved.59\\nDespite the fact that abundant nutritional resources are available\\nduring missions and there is no increase in energy consumption,\\nastronauts may experience a reduction in their food intake, a\\nphenomenon known as anorexia in space. The cosmonauts’\\nweight loss and reduction in body mass appear to be linked to\\nthe influence of microgravity and to changes in the sleep–wake\\ncycle on appetite, food intake, and the functioning of the gastro-\\nintestinal system. However, after returning to Earth, the crew\\nmembers will regain their preflight levels of body mass and caloric\\nintake.60 It has been suggested that the continuous light environ-\\nment of space missions is the cause of the reduction in caloric\\nintake to 70% of that recommended.61\\nFinally, the isolation occuring during the missions seems to\\nprovoke some psychopathological disorders in the astronauts, such\\nas illusions, hallucinations, and reductions in consciousness. In\\nfact, in situations of sensory deprivation, misrecognition can be a\\nconsequence of lack of training and incorrect perception of a\\nstimulus.54 It is interesting to note that in 2011, the Russian\\nnewspaper Pravda reported the presence of olfactory hallucinations\\namong the crew who took part in the 1984 Soyuz T-10 to Salyut-7\\nmissions, but the presence of toxins in the station’s atmosphere was\\ncited as the main cause of this phenomenon.62\\nIt should be, however, mentioned that space missions do not\\nnecessarily may lead to negative consequences, as they may repre-\\nsent personal growth experiences for many individuals, so that they\\nmight promote the overall sense of well-being, similarly to other\\nisolation experiences.15,63\\nPsychological aftermath following return on Earth\\nThe evidence of psychological or mental disorders after space\\nmissions is weak, if compared with current knowledge about\\nproblems arising during the space missions. The careful selection\\nand the psychological screening of cosmonauts operated in the\\ninitial phases may explain the apparent lack of evidence. However,\\nit should be noted that up to 5% of the crews of Antarctic\\nexpeditions, an environment that shares similar characteristics\\nwith the space, may experience psychiatric disorders, including\\nmood disorders.64 Further, the careful psychological and psychi-\\natric screening performed on astronauts does not predict the\\nabsence of behavioral and psychological problems after the mis-\\nsions.65\\nIn any case, return on Earth can be stressful and demanding for\\nreasons such as re-joining to an open society and to the family after\\na period in a small environment.66 The first 2 weeks after returning\\nto Earth represent a particularly critical period in which negative\\neffects on mood and performance can be expected, induced by\\nchanges in gravity and general living conditions, that is, readjust-\\nment to Earth.67 Interestingly, confrontations in the form of either\\naggressive or assertive interactions in order to resolve a situation\\nhave been more frequently reported after space flight, albeit seldom\\nindicated in the course of the mission in a research involving a\\ngroup of retired cosmonauts.68\\nThe most frequent psychological and psychosocial issues\\nreported include depressive symptoms, substance abuse, jealousy\\nand conjugal problems, and divorces.8–10\\nConclusions\\nSpace exploration is a fascinating human goal that, however, entails\\na series of hazards with detrimental physical and psychological\\nconsequences. Therefore, the issue of psychological well-being and\\nmental health of astronauts has been included in the Human\\nResearch Program at NASA that, in 2016, delivered some general\\nguidelines on this topic. The stringent selection criteria of candi-\\ndates are considered the most important prevention countermea-\\nsure\\nduring\\nboth\\nprelaunch\\nand\\ntraining\\nphases.\\nThe\\npsychotherapeutic support during the mission and upon return\\nto the Earth is also suggested to represent another valid instrument\\nto be provided not only to the the crews, but even to their families/\\nrelatives. The possibility of psychiatric emergencies has also been\\nconsidered, and antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and\\neven physical restraint tools are now available on the ISS.\\nAlthough it should be underlined that the available data are still\\nlimited and mainly deriving from studies from Earth environments\\nsimilar to space, nevertheless the mounting interest and implemen-\\ntation of future and long-lasting space missions warn and require\\nappropriate awareness of all the risks that these flights pose to the\\nCNS of the crews, that have been documented in a few magnetic\\nresonance studies.69–71\\nFurther studies are urgently needed in this field given the\\nrenewed interest and fundings of space exploration, including the\\nMoon landing of the first woman in 2024 (Artemis Project of\\nNASA), and the exploration of Mars and beyond. These exciting\\nprograms represent a challenge possibly requiring the birth of a\\nnovel branch of psychology/psychiatry devoted to the implemen-\\ntation of targeted strategies to possibly prevent risks related to space\\nexploration and to ensure the maintenance of well-being among\\nastronauts during and after their missions.\\n538\\nD.

The development of advanced technologies has \\nmade it possible to achieve objectives previously considered dreams and to widen \\nmore and more the limits that the human species can overcome. The dangers that \\nastronauts may face are not minimal, and the impacts on physical and mental health \\nmay be significant. Specifically, symptoms of emotional dysregulation, cognitive \\ndysfunction, disruption of sleep-wake rhythms, visual phenomena and significant \\nchanges in body weight, along with morphological brain changes, are some of the \\nmost frequently reported occurrences during space missions. \\nGiven the renewed interest and investment on space explorations, the aim of this \\npaper was thus to summarize the evidence of the currently available literature, and to \\noffer an overview of the factors that might impair the psychological well-being and \\nmental health of astronauts.\\nTo achieve the goal of this paper, the authors accessed some of the main databases \\nof scientific literature and collected evidence from articles that successfully fulfilled \\nthe purpose of this work.\\nThe results of this review demonstrated how the psychological and psychiatric \\nproblems occurring during space missions are manifold and related to a multiplicity \\nof variables, thus requiring further attention from the scientific community as new \\nchallenges lie ahead, and prevention of mental health of space travelers should be \\ncarefully considered.\\nKey words: space missions, space travel, astronauts, mental health, mental well-being\\nAlessandro Arone1, Tea Ivaldi1, Konstantin Loganovsky3, Stefania Palermo1, Elisabetta \\nParra1, Walter Flamini1, Donatella Marazziti1,2 \\n1 Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine Section of Psychiatry, University of \\nPisa, 56100 Pisa, Italy\\n2 Unicamillus—Saint Camillus International University of Medical and Health Sciences, \\n00131 Rome, Italy\\n3Department of Radiation Psychoneurology, Institute for Clinical Radiology, State Institution \\n“National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical \\nSciences of Ukraine”\\nIntroduction\\nSince its first steps on Earth, the human species \\nhas evolved by adapting and shaping the surrounding \\nenvironment to its needs. Yet nowadays, in a modern \\nera marked by pandemics, social inequalities, wars \\nand in which men still have much to discover despite \\nenormous advances in science and other fields, some \\nenvironments represent a huge challenge. This is due \\nto some of their features, to the point of being defined \\nas \"extreme environments\", as they often require \\nchallenging physical and mental efforts (Paulus et al., \\n2009; Ilardo & Nielsen, 2018). Extreme environments \\nare manifold, and they include prolonged and \\nmarked isolation experiences on Earth, such as polar \\nenvironments and submarine explorations, but they can \\nalso be found beyond our planet’s boundaries, in the case \\nof space. The adjustment from Earth to an environment \\ncharacterized by the lack of gravity naturally raises the \\nneed for physical adaptation primarily, but it may also \\nlead to the search for new horizons and to stimulation of \\ncreative thinking (Amabile & Gryskiewicz, 1987; Runco \\n& Charles, 1993), thus determining the exploitation \\nof mental resource that, however, in this process as \\nfascinating as rich in implications, must be preserved. \\nOver the decades, the public and scientific interest in \\nspace missions has progressively revealed the risks and \\ndangers to health behind this project, in particular in \\nthe case of long-duration space missions, as several \\nspace hazards, such as microgravity and radiation, \\ncan sharp different organs and systems by altering the \\nhuman physiology (Clément & Slenzka, 2006). From \\ncell damages (Huang et al., 2009; Kawahara et al., \\n2009) to the alteration of the processes maintaining \\nthe health of bones and muscles (Ilyina-Kakueva & \\nBurkovskaya, 1991; Kaplansky et al., 1991; Davidson \\n237\\nSubmitted August 2021, accepted September 2021\\nNARRATIVE REVIEW PAPER\\nAlessandro Arone et al.\\n238\\nClinical Neuropsychiatry (2021) 18, 5\\nand case reports if published in indexed journals. All \\nthe authors equally contributed in identifying potential \\ninformation specific to this topic amongst the titles and \\nabstracts evaluated. \\nResults\\nThe first selection excluded 2176 titles because: a) \\nduplicates; b) not concerning the scope of the paper; c) \\nnot informative enough. The second selection excluded \\n435 abstracts after being read and reviewed, as the \\ninformation presented did not fulfill the scope of our \\npaper and/or did not appear to be relevant to the topic \\nof interest. Subsequently, 114 more publications were \\nexcluded after further reading and evaluation, as they \\ndid not provide enough information and/or resulted \\nsufficiently in line with our review. Finally, 100 papers \\nwere included in this paper (figure 1). \\nDiscussion\\nHealth issues\\nIt has long been known that the health of space \\ntravelers can be endangered by various space factors, \\nto the point that the National Aeronautics and Space \\nAdministration (NASA) recognized the existence \\nof a new branch of science called “bioastronautics”, \\naimed at the study of the biological effects on the \\nastronauts’ bodies (Charles, 2005). In particular, most \\nof the gathered evidence to this day suggests that space \\nmicrogravity and radiation stand among the most \\nknown space perils (table 1).\\nSeveral studies have pointed out how microgravity \\nmay alter cell physiology by compromising its structure \\nor its survival (Crawford-Young, 2006; Huang et \\nal., 2009; Kawahara et al., 2009). Furthermore, a \\nrelationship has been described between microgravity \\nand the immune system (Woods & Chapes, 1994; \\nSonnenfeld, 2002; Gridley et al., 2009) that might lead \\nto the onset of infections, immune disorders and CNS \\nalterations that might affect the health of astronauts, \\nwith the consequent impairment of the positive \\nmission’s outcome. Microgravity may also negatively \\nimpact the mechanisms of tissue repair in skeletal \\nmuscles and bones (Ilyina-Kakueva & Burkovskaya, \\net al., 1999; Willey et al., 2011), the immune system \\n(Gridley et al., 2009), heart and vessels (Fritsch-Yelle \\net al., 1996; Diedrich al., 2007; Boerma et al., 2015) \\nand central nervous system (CNS) (Souvestre et al., \\n2008), space also increases the risk of carcinogenesis \\n(Kennedy, 2014), thus urging the search for drugs and \\ncompounds able to prevent or mitigate it (Burns et al., \\n2001; Zhang et al., 2006; Kennedy & Wan, 2011). Space \\nmissions, particularly of long duration, can put a strain \\non maintaining an adequate mental well-being, and \\nthe role of some personal and interpersonal factors has \\nlong been discussed (Kanas, 1998; Flynn, 2005; Barr et \\nal., 2007; Kalb & Solomon, 2007; Trappe et al., 2009; \\nFitts et al., 2010; Kandarpa et al., 2019; Marazziti et al., \\n2021). Both individually and in synergy, such factors \\nmay determine the onset of mood symptoms (Gushin \\net al., 1993; Tafforin et al., 2015), cognitive issues \\n(Britten et al., 2012; 2016; Rabin et al., 2014; Acharya \\net al., 2019; Cacao & Cucinotta, 2019; Moore et al., \\n2019), sleep disturbances (Putcha et al., 1999; Barger \\net al., 2014; Wotring, 2015) and others. Finally, space \\nmissions may cause some significant neuroanatomical \\neffects, with most of the data available coming from \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, and will \\nthen be briefly discussed herein.\\nTherefore, this paper was conceived as a narrative \\nreview with the aim of commenting on the current \\nliterature on the main psychological conditions \\naffecting astronauts in the course of space missions. We \\nalso investigated the possible aetiology of such issues, \\nwith a focus on the psychosocial and physical factors \\ninvolved.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nThe following databases were accessed in order \\nto research and gather data from articles that were \\npublished only in English language from 1 January \\n1963 to 31 August 2021: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, \\nPsycINFO and Google Scholar. Free text terms and \\nMeSH headings were combined as follows: “(space \\nmissions OR space travels OR astronauts) AND \\n(psychological OR psychiatric OR psychosocial OR \\nissues OR symptoms)”. All the authors agreed to \\ninclude in the review conference abstracts, posters \\nFigure 1. Flowchart\\nThe burden of space exploration on the mental health of astronauts: A narrative review\\nClinical Neuropsychiatry (2021) 18, 5\\n239\\nPsychological and psychiatric problems\\nEmotional and interpersonal issues\\nEmotion regulation seems to need appropriate \\ncountermeasures during long-duration space flights, \\nas emotion training can play an important role in the \\nsuccess and safety of missions (Liu et al., 2016). Mood \\nissues of the astronauts have long been reported, and \\nthey may also compromise the fulfillment of the mission \\ntask, as in the case of the abrupt abort of the Soyuz \\nT14-Salyut 7 mission in 1985, which was suggested to \\nhave been partly caused by crew\\'s depression (Morris, \\n2014). Symptoms of reduced resilience may occur, \\nranging from decreased drive and energy levels to \\npassiveness (Gushin et al., 1993). Anxiety symptoms \\nhave been reported and linked to negative interpersonal \\ninteractions, as well (Tafforin et al., 2015). Indeed, the \\nheterogeneity of the space crew in terms of size, ethnic \\nbackground, languages and roles may result in tension \\nand communication issues among the crew members \\n(Kanas, 1998). Prolonged isolation from loved ones and \\nroutine on Earth also pose a risk for the mental well-\\nbeing of cosmonauts (Kandarpa et al., 2019), along \\nwith sharing a confined environment with the same \\npeople around (Harrison et al., 1989). Indeed, isolation \\nmay lead to monotony, which has been conceptualized \\nas a three-fold model of spatio-temporal, sensory and \\nsocial isolation and has been proven to be potentially \\ndetrimental for the success of the mission (Peldszus et \\nal., 2014). Evidence from space analogues would also \\nsuggest that such factors may be responsible for a wide \\nrange of symptoms, including fatigue, altered circadian \\nrhythms, \\nsleep \\ndisturbance \\nand \\nneurocognitive \\nimpairments (Pagel & Choukèr, 2016; Deming & \\nVasterling, 2017). Moreover, the features of the \\nspacecraft, which constitute the so-called “habitability” \\n(Musso et al., 2018) represent a fundamental element \\nof space missions, for reasons exceeding far beyond \\nits sole role as a means of transport, and may represent \\nanother stressor to the overall well-being of the \\nastronauts. According to Kanas and Manzey (2008), \\nthese include light, noise, vibration and temperature. \\nAs for the light, since it represents the main stimulus \\nof the circadian rhythms, its excessive exposure may \\nthen lead to a deep alteration of the latter. Therefore, \\nit has been suggested how either its removal from the \\nsettings and the spaces dedicated to sleep or the creation \\nof an environment where alternating light and dark in \\nthe spaces shared by the astronauts may be desirable \\n(Caddick et al., 2017). Excessive exposure to noise, \\nmainly due to the equipment and the crew activities, \\nmay represent a further stress factor for cosmonauts. \\nBoth wakefulness and sleeping may be compromised, \\nto the point that cosmonauts have been instructed to \\nwear protection devices to counteract the potential \\n1991; Kaplansky et al., 1991; Davidson et al., 1999). \\nThe cardiovascular system may be affected as well, \\nsince several studies showed an important decrease in \\nheart rate during spaceflights (Fuller, 1985), the possible \\nonset of potentially fatal dysrhythmias (Fritsch-Yelle \\net al., 1996) and several changes in blood and plasma \\nvolume (Bao et al., 2007; Diedrich al., 2007). Post-flight \\northostatic intolerance has been frequently reported \\nin astronauts (Fritsch-Yelle et al., 1996). Finally, the \\nsensory-motor system appears to be deeply affected \\nby microgravity. Indeed, the CNS needs to adapt to \\nmicrogravity since different spatial information, such as \\nsomatosensory, visual and vestibular stimuli, has to be \\nelaborated (Souvestre et al., 2008). A syndrome known \\nas space adaptation syndrome (SAS) may occur as a \\nconsequence of a sensory conflict between inputs from \\nvisual and tactile senses and vestibular organs (Lackner \\n& Dizio, 2006). The eye is another organ that may be \\naffected by the effects of microgravity, with damages \\nto either its structure and/or its functions. Optic nerve \\nswelling, flattening of the posterior globe, periorbital \\nedema and increased intraocular pressure have all been \\nreported (West, 2000; Kramer et al., 2012). Hypobaric \\nhypoxia, a microgravity-induced condition caused by a \\ndecreased partial pressure of oxygen in space, may also \\noccur, potentially causing further eye diseases such as \\nretinal and vitreous hemorrhages or papilledema (Russo \\net al., 2014).\\nHealth professionals have long been warned about \\nthe negative and potentially catastrophic consequences \\nfor the human body following radiation exposure \\n(Meyers, 2000) and, in the course of space missions, \\ndifferent organs may be deeply affected by radiation. \\nBone loss and fractures may occur as a consequence of \\na disruption of the skeleton (Willey et al., 2011). The \\ncardiovascular system is also at risk, since it was found \\nto be particularly sensitive to the effect of ionizing \\nradiation (Boerma et al., 2015). Nevertheless, when it \\ncomes to radiation, the focus is primarily on the risk \\nof carcinogenesis, with the focus being shifted over \\nthe years to the search of potential surrogate endpoint \\nbiomarkers (SEBs) to explain this phenomenon \\n(Kennedy, 2014). Regardless, it has been suggested that \\nradiation exposure may lead to oxidative stress, which \\nin turn may be behind the mechanisms of carcinogenesis \\n(Kennedy & Wan, 2011). Therefore, unsurprisingly, \\nantioxidants, along with protease inhibitors and \\nretinoids, have been proposed as chemopreventive \\nagents to oppose the risk of carcinogenesis (Burns et \\nal., 2001; Zhang et al., 2006; Kennedy & Wan, 2011), \\nalbeit further studies on the field are required to draw \\ndefinitive conclusions.\\nTable 1.

This caused learning and memory \\nimpairment, and was linked to the potential increase of \\nanxiety behaviors, thus also indicating damage to the \\namygdala (Acharya et al., 2019). Some studies pointed \\nout a significant reduction in dendritic complexity and \\nspine density not only in the hippocampal but also in \\ncortical neurons (Parihar et al., 2015; 2016). Moreover, \\nastronauts may undergo deficits in executive functions \\ndue to a functional loss in several areas of the brain, \\nsuch as the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, \\nanterior cingulate and basal forebrain (Lonart et al., \\n2012). Decision-making may also be affected (Acharya \\net al., 2019). Indeed, it is a common assumption that \\none out of five astronauts taking part in a long space \\nmission would experience similar behaviors, and \\nout of three would instead face struggles in memory \\nprocesses (Acharya et al., 2019). Dopamine levels \\nmay be another key factor in neurobehavioral response \\nto radiation (Hienz et al., 2010), ando also gender, \\nas murine models showed how male mice displayed \\nan increased susceptibility to behavioral decrements \\nsecondary to radiation (Krukowski et al., 2018). \\nDifferent male susceptibility to cognitive processes \\nto irradiation may be due to mechanisms related to \\nmemory formation (Greene-Schloesser et al., 2012; \\nBalentova & Adamkov, 2015). Therefore, it is evident \\nthat such effects need to be adequately studied in the \\nfuture planning of interplanetary space fights.\\nCognitive issues may also arise due to the effects \\nof microgravity. Indeed, a reduction in different motor \\nfunctions, such as dual-tasking, motion perception and \\nmanual dexterity, following a six-month period spent on \\nISS was recently demonstrated. However, it should be \\nnoted that these cognitive deficits were resolved in four \\ndays after landing. In any case, although this research \\nis affected by a major bias that is the small sample size \\nincluding eight astronauts only (Moore et al., 2019), \\nthese effects may be a cue of relevant changes in brain \\nstructure (Roberts et al., 2019). On the other hand, it has \\nbeen suggested that microgravity may actually improve \\ncognitive functions when taken out of a stress context \\nthat, instead, may represent the cause itself of cognitive \\nimpairment (Wollseiffen et al., 2016). \\nSleep disturbances\\nIn the course of space missions, the achievement \\nand maintenance of an adequate sleep quality is far \\nfrom being an easy goal. Whether due to disturbances \\nor its interruption, sleep alterations may in turn lead to \\ntiredness, difficulties in maintaining the focus and, thus, \\nto errors of different kind, which may result, in the worst \\ncase scenarios, to the extreme possibility of loss of life \\n(Buckey, 2006; Pandi-Perumal & Gonfalone, 2016).\\nDifferent factors may be involved, either individually \\nor in combination, to sleep alterations, such as the \\nuncomfortableness of sleeping bags, loud noises and \\ndifferent room temperatures (Gundel et al., 1997; Stuster, \\n2000). The absence of gravity also seems to play an \\nimportant role, as it may in particular shorten the duration \\nof sleep (Gonfalone, 2016). \\nIn particular, recreational and mission-related \\nactivities tend to delay turning off the lights and going \\nto bed, which could explain the delay in the onset of \\nthe sleep episode that was noted (Dijk et al., 2001). In \\naddition, a study of a group of astronauts in space over \\neight days showed an average of 4.6 awakenings per \\nnight and an average waking time during sleep of 6.5 \\nminutes. The most frequent cause of these nocturnal \\ndamages induced by high levels of noise (Limardo et \\nal., 2017). \\nFinally, habitability includes the need for privacy \\nthat, considering the spaces available and the peculiar \\nenvironment, may not be always sufficiently respected, \\nthus \\nleading \\nto \\npossible \\npsychological \\neffects \\n(Winisdoerffer & Soulez-Larivière, 1992).\\nCognitive problems\\nAlthough fascinating, space poses as a seriously \\nstressful environment, and may therefore represent a \\ndanger to cognitive functions that, along with motor \\nperformances, have long been known to undergo some \\nkind of deterioration under stress conditions (Hockey, \\n1983; Albery & Goodyear, 1989; Lieberman et al., \\n2002).\\nSpace radiation is one of the factors most involved \\nin the onset of these issues, and its potential biological \\neffects are broad, even at a low-dose rate exposure, \\nthat has been demonstrated to induce significant \\nneurocognitive complications associated with an \\nimpairment in neurotransmission (Acharya et al., 2019).\\nOriginally, back to the 1960s, the general assumption \\nwas that the brain is not sensitive to the effect of \\ncosmic radiation, and even the consequences on other \\nbody areas, such as the lens of the eye, were thought \\nto be minimal (Curtis, 1963). However, a few decades \\nafter the original assumptions of Curtis (1963), it was \\ndemonstrated that high linear energy transfer (LET) \\nparticle irradiation of the brain may cause capillary \\nhemorrhages, and that both neuroglia and blood-brain \\nbarrier may be vulnerable to damage following ionizing \\nradiation. Since DNA repair in neural cells has a certain \\namount of mispair, such damages may produce different \\nnotable effects, including myelin degeneration, a \\nreduction in local metabolism, and alterations in both \\nsynaptic density and microcirculation. Scientists and \\nhealth professionals have long warned about adverse \\nconsequences following radiation exposure (Meyers, \\n2000), as well as many secondary effects in cognition \\nand mood due to a decrease in neuronal structural \\ncomplexity (Parihar et al., 2015; 2016).\\nAs a result, it is not surprising that the radiation \\nmatter has gone under the lens of NASA, since the \\nsafety of space travellers and the success of missions \\nmay indeed be compromised by the neurocognitive \\neffects induced by radiation (Cucinotta et al., 2014). \\nIndeed, radiation exposure is massive during space \\nmissions. The estimated average astronaut’s radiation \\nexposure to Mars per year is equivalent to a cumulative \\ndose of 672 millisieverts (mSv), and, in International \\nSpace Station (ISS) orbit, around 182.5 mSv. In order to \\nget an estimate of the extent of such numbers, it should \\nbe highlighted that the average background radiation \\nexposure on Earth per year is, instead, of 3 mSv (Jones \\net al., 2012). \\nA large amount of data on the matter comes \\nfrom rodent models strongly, suggesting potentially \\nsignificant consequences of radiation on cognition \\n(Britten et al., 2012; 2016; Rabin et al., 2014; Cacao \\n& Cucinotta, 2019). Furthermore, other researchers \\nrecently demonstrated that several alterations in the \\nintrinsic electrophysiological features of CA1 superficial \\nlayer pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus may \\nrepresent a consequence of the exposure to a prolonged \\n18 cGy dose of neutron radiation. These changes \\nmay persist after six months from the completion of \\nirradiation (Acharya et al., 2019). They also found \\nthat chronic (6 months) radiation exposure to low-\\ndose (18 cGy) and dose rate (1 mGy/day) exposures to \\nThe burden of space exploration on the mental health of astronauts: A narrative review\\nClinical Neuropsychiatry (2021) 18, 5\\n241\\nthat different types of examined radiation might cause \\nsignificant differences in the responses of endothelial \\ncells to such harmful factors. Indeed, low doses of 160 \\nenhanced apoptosis in the endothelial cells of the retina, \\nwith the most significant changes observed following 0.1 \\nGy irradiation, whilst 160-induced apoptosis was found \\nto be more frequent than apoptosis caused by protons \\n(Mao et al., 2018).\\nMoreover, during the Apollo, Skylab and MIR \\nmissions, astronauts observed flashes of light, of \\ndifferent shapes, moving across the visual field (Sannita \\net al., 2006). Such flashes are more often present before \\nsleep, predominantly white, with elongated shapes and \\noften accompanied by a sense of movement perceived \\nas lateral, diagonal or in-out (Fuglesang et al., 2006). \\nIt has been suggested how these phosphenes can be a \\nconsequence of an alteration in perception caused by \\nionizing radiation on the eye (Narici, 2008). In particular, \\ntemporarily increased biophoton emission has been \\nproposed as a key process which may give an accurate \\ndescription of the matter (Bókkon, 2008). Indeed, \\nthe ionizing radiation impacting in the eye generates \\nradicals, some of these generated in rod lipids undergo \\nlipid peroxidation that leads to chemiluminescence and \\nphoton emission. At this point, the photon bleaches a \\nnearby rhodopsin and the phototransduction cascade \\nis initiated, which can lead then to the perception of \\nflashes of light (Bókkon, 2008; Narici et al., 2009), \\ngiving the impression that light is visible where it is not \\npresent and thus posing as a new potential hazard tied to \\nspace radiation. Nevertheless, whether this represents a \\nreversible or persistent phenomenon is still an unsolved \\nquestion, requiring future research. However, it should be \\nmentioned that the effects of radiation exposure on sight \\nare well documented, as they may even lead to impairing \\nmedical conditions such as posterior subcapsular cataract \\n(Khan et al., 2017). \\nRegardless, \\nillusions \\nand \\nhallucinations \\nalso \\nfrequently appeared in some reports of space missions, \\npossibly as a result of isolation or sensory deprivation \\n(Gushin et al., 1993).\\nAnorexia in space\\nCaloric intake may be lower than recommended in \\nthe course of space flights, thus leading to the so-called \\nanorexia in space. Caloric deficits up to 1330 kcal per \\n70 kg astronaut per day may follow, with potential drops \\nin the performances of the astronauts (Da Silva et al., \\n2002). The causes of this phenomenon are likely related \\nto the continuous light environment of space missions \\nrather than to issues linked to the availability of food or \\nenergy expenditure (Varma et al., 2000), with several \\nneurochemical mediators (i.e. hormones and cytokines) \\ninvolved (Da Silva et al., 2002). The food intake of mice \\nexposed to 24 hours of continuous light for 7 days was \\nassessed and a significant reduction in meal numbers \\nwas found, resulting in increased concentrations of \\ndopamine and serotonin in the ventromedial nucleus and \\nlateral hypothalamic area, plasma cortisol and leptin, and \\ndecreased levels of insulin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), \\noestradiol and testosterone. The results of this study \\nmake it possible to hypothezise an action of continuous \\nlight on the suprachiasmatic nucleus and ventromedial \\nnucleus, resulting in endocrine and neurochemical \\nchanges (Varma et al., 2000). Ionizing radiation may also \\nplay an important role in spatial anorexia by causing taste \\naversion and vomiting. Similarly, microgravity may be \\ninvolved (Da Silva et al., 2002)\\nNevertheless, it should be noted that current \\nevidence suggests that anorexia in space is a reversible \\nawakenings was muscle stiffness as a result of trying to \\nfind a comfortable position in the sleeping bag (Gundel \\net al., 1993). In parallel, a change in the structure of the \\ncosmonauts\\' sleep was also observed, with changes in \\nboth REM sleep and the amount of slow-wave sleep \\n(Gundel et al., 1993).\\nIn order to study the sleep-wake dynamics in a \\nground-based simulation of a mission to Mars, six \\nindividuals were isolated for 520 days. Most subjects \\nexperienced one or more problems, such as recurrent \\nreductions in perceived sleep quality, interrupted sleep-\\nwake periodicity, performance deficits associated with \\nchronic partial sleep deprivation and increased sleep \\ndisplacement in the daytime period (Basner et al., 2013). \\nThese occurred at the start of the experiment and persisted \\nthroughout the duration of the simulation (Basner et al., \\n2013). This reduction in sleep during space missions \\nseems to be present even during a pre-flight training \\ninterval of 3 months, as revealed in another study of 64 \\nastronauts (Barger et al., 2014). Although derived from \\ntwo studies only, these findings further suggest that \\nmaintaining good sleep patterns and quality is essential \\nto prevent and/or reduce performance impairments.\\nIn spite of chronic sleep deprivation, astronauts may \\nfrequently resort to the use of hypno-inducing drugs. In \\na report study of Barger et al. (2014), about 75% of the \\ncrew members had taken a hypno-inducer, with drug \\ntake being reported on 52% of nights and the use of \\ntwo doses of such drugs in around 17% of cases. The \\nmost frequently used medications were zolpidem and \\ncontrolled-release zolpidem; others were temazepam, \\neszopiclone, melatonin and quetiapine fumarate. \\nFurthermore, different drug combinations were reported, \\nthe most common being zolpidem and zaleplon and \\nzolpidem and melatonin (Barger et al., 2014). Another \\nstudy looked at medication used during flight and found \\nthat 94% of astronauts were taking some medication, \\n45% for sleep disorders. In this case, the most frequently \\nused sleep medications were temazepam (67%), \\ntriazolam (10%), flurazepam (7.5%), and zolpidem \\n(10%) (Putcha et al., 1999). In another research, the use \\nof sleep medications was found to be about 10 times \\nhigher during spaceflight missions, 71% of the crew \\nmembers in one study reported using medications to \\ninduce or maintain sleep and the most commonly were \\nzolpidem, zaleplon, ot both (Wotring, 2015). \\nHowever, hypnic dysregulation should not be \\nconsidered separately from other medical issues that \\nmay arise in the course of space missions. Indeed, it may \\nbe subsequential to anxiety, depression and personality \\nchanges, interpersonal problems (i.e. intra-crew conflicts), \\nand physiological reactions to a new environment, such \\nas muscle atrophy, a reduced immune response and \\nchanges in regards to cardiovascular system. All those \\nfactors may indeed alter the sleep pattern, which may \\nin turn aggravate psychological and physical stress in a \\nvicious cycle (Kanas & Manzey, 2008).\\nVisual phenomena\\nVisual disturbances may also represent a critical issue \\nto space flights, and radiation exposure plays a key role in \\ntheir genesis, likely along with the effects of intracerebral \\npressure changes. This is critical since visual impairment \\nmay compromise the fulfillment of the space missions \\ngoals and potentially lead to long-term consequences on \\nthe cosmonauts’ life quality upon their return to home. \\nDespite playing a key role in the functioning of vision, \\nthe retina and the retinal vasculature have not been \\nconsiderably studied in regards to radiation exposure \\nduring space travel. A recent paper would indicate \\nAlessandro Arone et al.\\n242\\nClinical Neuropsychiatry (2021) 18, 5\\nof ventricular CSF volume in the ISS group (Alperin \\net al., 2017).

The cerebellum, along \\nwith cortical sensorimotor and somatosensory areas, as \\nwell as pathways related to the vestibular system, may \\nalso be subjected to significant changes in both their \\nstructural and functional component, mainly under the \\nphenomenon, as cosmonauts’ body mass and caloric \\nintake were comparable to those before the missions \\nupon their return on Earth (Da Silva et al., 2002). \\nNeuroanatomical correlates\\nData gathered from studies using different \\nneuroimaging techniques seem to suggest that different \\nareas of the CNS and the peripheral nervous system \\n(PNS) may be affected by the consequences of space \\nTable 2.

Further \\nevidence derives from a functional MRI (fMRI) \\nresearch involving a single cosmonaut over a period of \\n6 months subsequently to microgravity exposure. The \\nauthors reported significant changes in both vestibular \\nand motor-related regions that, according to them, \\nmight underlie the alteration of the vestibular function \\nand of the motor control skills after return on Earth \\n(Demertzi et al., 2016). Instead, a study employing \\nquantitative MRI detected multiple grey and white \\nmatter alterations in a sample of 19 astronauts, such as \\nthinning of the cerebral cortex of the right occipital lobe \\nand of bilateral fusiform gyri, a decreased left thalamus \\nsize and an expansion of lateral ventricle (Riascos \\net al., 2019). An increase in periventricular white \\nmatter hyperintensity was found in another research \\nperformed in a sample of 17 astronauts who had either \\ntaken part to a long-duration mission on ISS or a short-\\nduration mission on the Space Shuttle (Alperin et al., \\n2017). This finding was further linked to an expansion \\ninfluence of microgravity, as proved in a recent research \\nperformed with the use of fMRI (Buoite Stella et al., \\n2021).\\nTherefore, further studies with MRI or other \\nimaging techniques carried out with larger samples are \\nnecessary to deepen these preliminary data that pose \\nthe crucial questions of the reversibility or not of the \\nreported changes.\\nConclusions\\nSpace exploration was born as one of the most \\nground-breaking events that mark the history of the \\nhuman species, that continues to this day to be a primary \\ninterest of the scientific community and beyond.

To counteract the adverse factors of\\nspace ﬂight, Soviet specialists in the 70s of the 20th century\\ndeveloped a system of measures for psychological prevention and\\ncorrection,\\nconventionally\\nnamed\\n“psychological\\nsupport”.\\nAccording to Kozerenko et al. (2001), psychological support\\n(PS) for space crews is deﬁned as a set of psychological\\nmethods, tools, and measures used by the mission control\\nservices to preserve the psychological health and mental well-\\nbeing of astronauts under unfavorable conditions of extended\\nspace ﬂight. The psychological support system was built in such a\\nway that each group of unfavorable factors of space ﬂight is\\nopposed to a corresponding system of preventive measures\\n(Gushin et al., 2020).\\nBeing in orbit is associated with a prolonged stay in\\nmicrogravity in a conﬁned small chamber environment. This\\ndeprives the astronaut of the usual inﬂux of visual, auditory, and\\ntactile stimuli of the natural terrestrial environment, as well as a\\ncomplex of vestibular signals associated with the effects of\\nplanetary gravity (Kanas, 2015). Along with the decrease in\\nthe volume of incoming information in ﬂight, its diversity also\\ndecreases. It is caused not only by the monotonous environment\\ncreated by life support systems but also by the ﬂight protocol with\\nfrequent repetition of stereotypical actions for the maintenance\\nof station systems (Kanas et al., 2009). Therefore, the appearance\\nof psychological problems is associated with the processes of\\nasthenization of the central nervous system, progressing decrease\\nof its tone under sensory deprivation and causing inadequate\\nreactions to incoming stimuli (Myasnikov and Stepanov, 2002).\\nIts manifestations were vividly described for astronauts and polar\\nwinterers and could lead to increasing fatigue, deterioration of\\ncognitive functions, stereotyping of actions, the appearance of\\nanxiety, boredom, and loss of motivation and morale (Palinkas\\nand Suedfeld, 2008). Psychological support measures for\\nreconstruction of the usual sensory inﬂux include prevention\\nof the occurrence of sensory deprivation caused by the combined\\neffect of sensory deprivation and monotony. They include\\nregular provision of the crew members with the additional\\nsources of external stimuli like fresh news, books, movies,\\nmusic, and videos from Earth.\\nAnother important group of unfavorable factors of long-term\\nspace ﬂight is deﬁned in the works of M.A. Novikov and his\\ncolleagues as the imposed nature of communication and the\\nrestriction of social contacts (Novikov, 1970). In ﬂight, crew\\ncommunications are an element of professional activity and are\\nassociated with the mandatory informing of the MCC about the\\nlife of the crew and receiving instructions and recommendations.\\nAn\\nincrease\\nin\\nthe\\nvolume\\nof\\nmandatory\\nprofessional\\ncommunication is combined with a decrease in the number\\nand duration of contacts with the cosmonaut’s inner social\\ncircle. A person in orbit may lose part of the usual social\\nsupport from relatives and friends. As a result, a feeling of\\nloneliness and isolation from the usual environment appear,\\nsometimes having an adverse effect on the family life of an\\nastronaut. (Suedfeld, 2018). The conditions of crowding,\\ncombined with a high level of stress, can provoke conﬂict\\ntension in a small group, a struggle for leadership in the crew.\\nTherefore,\\nanother\\narea\\nof psychological\\nsupport\\nis the\\npreservation\\nof\\nthe\\nusual\\ncircle\\nof\\ncommunication,\\nmaintaining the social ties of the crew in ﬂight. It is\\nmaintained by the PS specialists who organize regular video\\nconferences with families, friends, and VIPs for the astronauts\\n(Johnson, 2010). Also, mission controllers are aware that crew\\nmembers could transfer anger and aggression outside to prevent\\nconﬂict within the crew (Kanas et al., 2009). They are ready for\\nthis\\ndraining\\nof\\nnegativity\\nand\\ncould\\neven\\nprovoke\\nit\\nintentionally, to decrease psychological pressure within the crew.\\nSpace and polar expeditions also lead to the fact that crews\\nare forced to stay under conditions of crowding and lack of\\nprivacy. It should be noted that crowding and lack of privacy are\\nproblems relevant both for staying under lockdown conditions\\n(due to a new coronavirus infection) and for a number of extreme\\nprofessions (for example, employees of oil rigs in the open sea)—\\nand for the modern urban environment as a whole.\\nAt orbital stations, the problem of lack of privacy is solved by\\nallocating personal spaces (cabins) for astronauts, but such\\nsolutions are limited by a shortage of resources and a small\\nhabitable volume of orbital stations.\\nSocial isolation and restriction of freedom, as well as the\\nphenomenon of crowding, contradict the socio-psychological\\nnature of man. As a rule, people face similar conditions in\\nexceptional\\nsituations.\\nClosed\\nspace\\nand\\nlimited\\ngroup\\ninteraction can be observed while working on submarines, on\\nArctic and island expeditions, and in spacecraft and stations, as\\nwell as during stay in places of imprisonment and hospitalization.\\nResearch conducted back in the 1960s and 70s by I. Altman\\nshowed that for people who stay in small residential areas for a\\nlong time, the territoriality of behavior is characteristic, and\\nviolation of boundaries or rules of behavior in a group provokes\\nconﬂict situations. Studying the behavior of people under\\nconditions of crowding, I. Altman introduced the concept of\\nprivacy, which means “selective control of access to oneself”\\nachieved by modifying the environment, which includes both\\nphysical and socio-cultural components. Privacy is ensured\\nthrough various forms of verbal and nonverbal behavior.\\nLater, in the course of an experiment simulating the work of\\nastronauts\\nunder\\nconditions\\nof\\nextreme\\ncrowding,\\nthe\\nphenomenon of the transition of personal intersubjective\\nterritory into the category of interpersonal space was revealed,\\nwhile the problems of living together in these conditions are\\nsolved by personalizing individual and group territories. Further\\nstudies conducted, in particular, on densely populated urbanized\\nFrontiers in Physiology\\nfrontiersin.org\\n02\\nRozanov et al.\\n10.3389/fphys.2022.926597\\nareas, conﬁrmed the relevance of psychological problems\\nassociated\\nwith\\ncrowding,\\nviolation\\nof\\npsychological\\nboundaries, and lack of privacy. The predominance of a\\nnegative psycho-emotional background (an increase in the\\nlevel of aggression) develops as a result of the difﬁculty in\\nrealizing the normal, physiologically conditioned, human need\\nfor personal space (the need for territoriality), as well as a result of\\nphysical violation of personal boundaries, lack of space, and\\nisolation. The results of the research study show that crowding\\nand high social density can give rise to a feeling of anxiety in a\\nperson and worsen mood (Saegert, 1975). At the same time, men\\nexperience\\nmore\\nnegative\\nemotions\\nunder\\nconditions\\nof\\nincreased density than in situations of reduced spatial density,\\nwhereas reduced density has a more depressing effect on women\\n(Freedman et al., 1972). Studies show that prolonged stay of men\\nin space with high crowding increases the level of cortisol in the\\nblood (Heshka and Pylypuk, 1975).\\nThus, in isolation, stable asthenization is formed under the\\ninﬂuence of sensory deprivation, monotony, the forced nature of\\ncommunication contacts, increased inactivity, and hypokinesia.\\nIt is quite natural that a person’s emotional reaction to isolation\\nand crowding is usually sharply negative.\\nUsually, several terrestrial models are used as analogs of\\nspace ﬂight, like polar expeditions or chamber isolation studies\\n(Palinkas et al., 2000). Vice versa, we describe several simulations\\nand models that are commonly used in space medicine as analogs\\nfor the civil medicine cases and practices in the following\\nsections. The objective of this study is to conﬁrm the effects\\nof space PS under conditions that simulate both space ﬂight\\nfactors and medical conditions and the practice of civil\\n(terrestrial) medicine.\\nExperimental models and research\\nresults\\nModel 1—dry immersion\\nDry immersion (DI) is one of the most widely used ground\\nmodels of microgravity. DI accurately and rapidly reproduces\\nmost of the physiological effects of short-term space ﬂights.\\nWithin this model, healthy volunteers are placed, individually\\nor in pairs, in a supine position in a covered bath that was ﬁlled\\nwith water at a temperature of 33 ± 0.5°C. The daily routine is\\nspeciﬁed in accordance with the schedule of studies and\\ncountermeasure procedures (if the experiment included\\nthem),\\nincluding\\n8 h\\nof\\nsleep,\\n3–4\\nmeals,\\na\\nmedical\\nsupervision program, and experimental studies. The model\\nsimulates such factors of space ﬂight as mechanical and axial\\nunloading as well as physical inactivity (Tomilovskaya et al..,\\n2019). We regard dry immersion as a perfect simulation of\\nstaying of bedridden patients in the hospital (i.e., after\\nsurgery). In both cases, subjects are limited in motor\\nactivities, sensory and socially deprived, and have problems\\nwith organization of their free time.\\nThe negative impact of hypokinesia on mental health both\\nunder the conditions of model experiments including DI and\\nextended stay in the hospital and under the conditions of space\\nﬂight arises as a result of a discrepancy between the afferent\\n(sensitive) link of the central nervous system under load and\\nanother link (effector, i.e., motor), limited by the load of the\\ngeneral functional chain of motor acts. Negative, subjectively\\n“difﬁcult” mental states perceived by recipients may be expressed\\nin neurotic manifestations. In particular, during the period of\\nacute adaptation to the conditions of the experiment, irritability,\\ncomplaints, increased conﬂict tension with the experiment staff,\\nincreased attention to one’s own proprioceptive sensations\\n(including pain), sleep disturbances at the stage of adaptation\\nto dry immersion, boredom, and problems with organizing free\\ntime can be observed (Rozanov et al., 2022).\\nIn October–December 2020, a 3-day dry immersion with the\\nparticipation of six women from 24 to 39 years old (the average\\nage is 30 years) was carried out on the basis of the IMBP RAS.\\nThe study was approved by the Commission on Biomedical\\nEthics of the IMBP RAS (Protocol No. 544 dated 06/16/2020).\\nThe recipients signed informed consent. It should be noted that\\nthe duration of immersion exposure (3 days) allowed us to\\nconsider this entire time interval as a period of acute\\nadaptation to stressful experimental conditions. In the 3-day\\ndry immersion aimed at studying the physiological and\\npsychophysiological state of the women’s body under the\\nconditions of modeling the factors of space ﬂight, the method\\nof psychological support based on VR technologies was tested.\\nThe objective of our study was to test the PS complex based\\non VR technologies and to study the psychophysiological effects\\nthat occurred in the recipients when they interacted with this\\ncomplex. In order to meet the safety criterion, preliminary\\ntraining of the subjects was conducted. According to the data\\nof medical (neurological) examinations after VR sessions, no\\nviolations were detected. The psychological safety of the content\\nwas ensured through the preliminary censorship of audiovisual\\nmaterials. The personiﬁcation of the presented content was\\nachieved\\nthrough\\na\\npreliminary\\nquestionnaire\\nabout\\npreferences and the subsequent formation of a “repertoire”\\nbased on their analysis. The principle of matching the\\ncorrespondence\\nof\\nthe\\nobjective\\nfunction\\nwas\\napplied.\\nAutonomous, i.e., not requiring connection to an external\\ncomputer, VR helmets with properties such as lightness of\\nconstruction, mobility, and ease of use were used. In addition,\\nthis “repertoire” was compiled taking into account the nature of\\nthe impact of the experimental conditions: immobilization,\\nstaying\\nin\\nan\\nunsupported\\nposition,\\nprolonged\\n(almost\\nconstant) staying in a supine position, redistribution of body\\nﬂuids, exceptionally small sensory inﬂux through a number of\\nsensory systems, and partial social deprivation (narrowing of the\\ncircle of social contacts and the predominance of forced and\\nFrontiers in Physiology\\nfrontiersin.org\\n03\\nRozanov et al.\\n10.3389/fphys.2022.926597\\nprofessional\\ncommunication).\\nThus,\\nto\\nprevent\\nactive\\nlocomotion while perceiving visual images, presented pictures\\nshould simulate ﬂying or gliding in an environment with low\\nresistance, like atmosphere or water. As a VR environment, we\\nused three-dimensional video, i.e., the content was non-\\ninteractive, not requiring active movements and other motor\\nactivity to interact with it—which is also necessary from the point\\nof view of maintaining the purity of the experiment. Based on\\nthis, the content of the videos included ﬂights above the planet’s\\nsurface (both characteristic of the place of residence of the\\nsubjects and exotic) and swimming in the sea among marine\\nanimals (Rozanov et al., 2021; Rozanov et al., 2022).\\nWe used non-invasive and objective research methods to\\nassess the psychophysiological effects of PS. The participants\\nrecorded semi-structured self-reports about their health, mood,\\nand working capacity. They were analyzed using Noldus\\nFaceReader software and speech content analysis to get the\\ndata about their emotional status and cognitive functions\\n(K:ntzler et al., 2021). With the help of this complex, the\\nseverity of the emotionality of the subjects was assessed in\\ncomparison\\nwith\\na\\ncalm\\nfacial\\nexpression.\\nFaceReader\\nsoftware is able to evaluate the following indicators based on\\nthe facial expressions of testers: neutral (lack of emotions),\\nvalence and arousal, and emotions such as happy, sad, angry,\\nsurprised, scared, and disgusted. This hardware and software\\ncomplex, as well as the corresponding computerized method of\\nanalysis, is an objective, validated method, widely implemented\\nin the practice of psychological research. Actigraphy was applied\\nto analyze subjects’ locomotion and sleep duration by sleep\\nanalysis using the Cole–Kripke algorithm (Cole et al.., 1992),\\ncalculations based on which were carried out using ActiLife\\nsoftware. Also, specially developed questionnaires were used\\nto obtain the data about subjects’ perception of the level of PS\\nprovided by the on-duty team (doctor, technician, and laboratory\\nassistant)\\nand\\nthe\\nVR\\nsessions.\\nThe\\nquestionnaire\\n“Immersiveness” was developed in order to evaluate the\\nsubjective “presence effect” that occurs in testers during a\\nvirtual\\nreality\\nsession\\n(synonyms—immersion\\neffect,\\nimmersiveness).\\nFor statistical analysis of this model study, methods such as\\nthe calculation of the Wilcoxon and Spearman criteria were used,\\nwhile the computer analysis was carried out in the SPSS program.\\nResults. In the self-reports during immersion, subjects, as\\nexpected, often complained about increasing fatigue caused by a\\n“tightly” compiled protocol of studies, boredom, and sleep\\ndisorders. These types of complaints were mentioned in 23.3%\\nof reports. Also, discomfort associated with difﬁculties in\\nperforming urination and defecation was mentioned. To\\nconclude, staying in dry immersion in general negatively\\naffected their psycho-emotional state.\\nAccording to the data of medical observation of the subjects\\nafter the VR sessions, four of them had a slightly pronounced\\npendulum-like ﬁne-grained binocular mixed nystagmus of the\\nﬁrst\\ndegree\\nthat\\ncan\\nbe\\nregarded\\nas\\nphysiological,\\nnot\\npathological,\\nnystagmus.\\nTwo\\nrecipients\\ndid\\nnot\\nreport\\nnystagmus at all. Nystagmus took place for 0.5–1.5 min after\\nthe end of the VR session. During the use of VR technical means\\nand the selected visual content, no cases of nausea, dizziness,\\nmotion sickness, or coordination disorders were detected in the\\nsubjects who were under the conditions of DI.\\nTo assess the impact of VR sessions on the cognitive and\\nemotional spheres, detection of speech errors and ﬁller words (or\\nhesitation marks, which are so-called in linguistics as discursive\\nand are markers of stress) in the transcripts of self-reports was\\ncarried out. It was found that the proportion of parasite words\\nand speech errors in self-reports after the VR session decreased\\nsigniﬁcantly (T = -2,201; p < 0.05). So, according to self-reports, a\\npositive effect of VR sessions on the cognitive functions of the\\nsubjects was also found (Rozanov et al., 2022).\\nTo estimate changes in the psycho-emotional status during\\ndry immersion, a comparison of the average values of basic\\nemotions was made using FaceReader. Facial expressions were\\nrecorded during DPC (daily planning conference, afternoon\\nplanning conference in the form of a structured self-report) of\\nthe recipients as well as before and after the VR session. A\\nstatistically signiﬁcant tendency to increase the proportion of the\\nneutral component in facial expressions was found (t = 3,155; p =\\n0,008). After the VR session, the proportion of neutral\\ncomponents in facial expression increased even more and was\\nalso statistically signiﬁcant (T = 2,605; p < 0.05). At the same\\ntime, the indicator of the level of arousal statistically signiﬁcantly\\ndecreased after the sessions (T = -0.973; p < 0.05). In other words,\\nthey were looking calmer and less tensed throughout the stressful\\nconditions that can be an indicator of gradual adaptation to the\\nexperimental conditions. From that point, the impact of VR can\\nbe regarded as relaxing.\\nThe effect of utilization of non-interactive VR content was\\nalso manifested in a decrease in the general volume of motor\\nactivity during the PS session. That was conﬁrmed by the fact that\\nthe maximum of the motion vector during VR sessions was on\\naverage 2.4 times lower than the maximum per day. The\\nmaximum of the motion vector after the VR session was less\\nin 13 out of 15 cases, 1.3 times on average (T = -2.48; p < 0.05).\\nWe suppose that a pronounced decrease in motor activity (and\\ncorresponding more pronounced tonic relaxation) during dry\\nimmersion also could be related to the facial expression of the\\nsubjects. For example, we detected an increase in the level of\\nhappiness emotion found by FaceReader before and after VR,\\nwhich negatively correlated with the ratio of the daily maximum\\nmotor activity (VM) (s = -0.741; p < 0.01). There was also a stable\\npositive correlation between the degree of immersion in visual\\nvirtual images and the difference in the severity of the arousal\\nemotional index before and after the VR session (s = 0.598; p <\\n0.05). This correlation suggests that more psychologically\\nimmersive images of VR, in all likelihood, caused a more\\npronounced decrease in the “arousal” index in the subjects.\\nFrontiers in Physiology\\nfrontiersin.org\\n04\\nRozanov et al.\\n10.3389/fphys.2022.926597\\nThe obtained results allow us to draw a preliminary\\nconclusion about the general relaxing and calming effect of PS\\nvia VR that reduces mental tension caused by adverse\\npsychological factors of dry immersion.\\nModel 2—isolation experiment\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the most severe\\ncrises for public health and society in recent times. With many\\nadverse consequences, such epidemics are always associated with\\nadverse consequences for mental health (Palinkas et al.., 2021).\\nThe critical reduction of sensory information may be also\\nexplained by the reduction of social contacts, which decreases\\nthe chance of additional veriﬁcation of social reality (Alle and\\nBernsten, 2021). It can make it difﬁcult to distinguish between\\nreality and imagination, which leads to distortions of perception,\\nderealization, and hallucinations. There are reasons to believe\\nthat social isolation associated with conﬁnement and monotony\\nunder\\nquarantine\\ncan\\nhave\\nimportant\\npsychological\\nconsequences in terms of increased psychotic symptoms and\\ncognitive problems (Fiorillo and Gorwood., 2020).\\nSuch problems were noticed in 2020 in Italy during the\\nsecond month of national isolation (D’Agostino et al.., 2020).\\nPatients without a psychiatric history could have hallucinations\\nand a somatic illusion that they were infected with the SARS-\\nCoV-2. That corresponds with the old isolation study made in the\\nmiddle of the 20th century by the McDonnell Douglas\\nCorporation (Gushin, 2020). A depressing psychological state\\nis also caused by uncertainty about the future, which is associated\\nwith a lack of data about the time of complete recovery from the\\ndisease on a global scale, as well as with a large number of\\nuncontrolled news. That is why researchers express concern\\nabout the negative impact of self-isolation on both individuals\\nwho are forced to face prolonged isolation for epidemiological or\\nmedical reasons and patients with mental illness, whose clinical\\noutcome may occur with the risk of exacerbation of symptoms\\nand possible relapse (Chaturvedi, 2020).\\nA short-term isolation (chamber) experiment can be\\nregarded as a short quarantine of the family group or small\\nprofessional group that was typical for the COVID pandemic.\\nThe ESKIS experiment with 14-day isolation and crowding of\\nthe mixed gender crew was carried out in the chamber of 50 cubic\\nmeters at the ground-based experimental complex (NEK) SSC\\nRF–IMBP RAS. Six practically healthy volunteers, four men and\\ntwo women (age 23–45 years), participated in the experiment.\\nFive of them had no previous experience in isolation experiments\\n(Gushin et al., 2020; Nosenkova, 2021). The daily routine was\\nspeciﬁed in accordance with the schedule of studies, including the\\nexecution of operator’s performance tasks, three meals, 8 h of\\nsleep, a medical supervision program, and experimental studies.\\nThe main psychological factors affecting the subjects during the\\nexperiment are typical for chamber conﬁnement studies (as well\\nas\\nisolation\\ncaused\\nby\\nepidemiological\\nreasons):\\nsensory\\ndeprivation,\\nmonotony,\\ncrowding,\\nlack\\nof\\nprivacy,\\nthe\\nlimitation\\nof\\nsocial\\ncontacts,\\nand\\nthe\\nforced\\nnature\\nof\\ncommunication (Feichtenger et al., 2012). It is important to\\nnote\\nthat\\nsubjects\\nexecuted\\nperformance\\ntasks,\\nwhich\\ncorresponds with a remote regime of working that was\\nestablished during the pandemic.\\nThe PS complex included PS sessions based on VR\\ntechnologies and sessions of “classical” psychological support,\\nsimilar to those used in orbital ﬂights. These included providing\\ncrew members with personalized multimedia content to view on\\npersonal tablets. This content was served by videos of a\\ndocumentary nature and relaxation orientation with views of\\nnature or space (for the creation of a “ﬂight image” for the crew\\nmembers) and also art therapy sessions, which included drawing\\non suggested topics and coloring books for adults. Sessions of\\neach type of PS were conducted four times during isolation for\\neach crew member in accordance with the cyclogram of the\\nexperiment.\\nFor VR-based PS sessions, a special hardware and software\\ncomplex was provided based on an autonomous portable VR\\nhelmet, and special software for this helmet was developed (and\\ntested for the ﬁrst time under extreme conditions in this\\nexperiment). This software was provided by IBMP specialists\\nin cooperation with AI Health LCC. It allows users to transfer to a\\nvirtual analog of the personal space: with the help of VR tools, an\\ninteractive image of a personal recreation room is created. In this\\nvirtual room, the user can make changes to the interior, change\\nthe weather and time of day outside the window of the room, and\\ncontrol the ﬁreplace according to personal preferences. A set of\\npersonal multimedia content is available from this room for\\nlistening and viewing.\\nWe supposed that subjects, who for the ﬁrst time faced a\\ncomplex of factors of isolation in a hermetic object, lack of\\npersonal space, and crowding, may experience anxiety—a state\\nassociated with a sense of uncertainty (Gushin, 2020). According\\nto space practice, PS under conditions of extreme conﬁnement,\\ncrowding, and isolation can be obtained via contact with mission\\ncontrollers (in this study, duty medical teams) or within the crew.\\nSocial support inside the cohesive crew is based, according to\\nWeiss, on the “availability of people you can rely on” (Sarason\\net al., 1990). Another source of PS included the provision of\\npersonalized\\nmultimedia\\ncontent\\nto\\ncompensate\\nsensory\\ndeprivation and monotony and organize leisure time. A VR\\ncomplex was also used, identical to the one used in dry\\nimmersion.\\nWe\\nexpected\\nthat\\nsubjects\\nwith\\nbetter\\ndeveloped\\ncommunicative\\nskills and extroverted personalities\\nwould\\nobtain PS mostly via contacts with the crew and supporting\\ngroup. On the other hand, subjects with dominating introversion\\ncould have problems with getting social support to withstand\\nsensory deprivation, monotony, and crowding. For them, PS via\\ncomputerized content, including the virtual reality environment,\\nFrontiers in Physiology\\nfrontiersin.org\\n05\\nRozanov et al.\\n10.3389/fphys.2022.926597\\nwhich is clearly dosed, contains preliminarily deﬁned relaxing\\ndata and provides an additional virtual space, should be the most\\npreferred type of psychological support.\\nThe research methods were similar to those in 3-day dry\\nimmersion. Also, Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) was\\nutilized to estimate the inﬂuence of personality traits on the\\npreferences of PS type. The questionnaire “psychological\\nsupport”,\\nwhich\\nwas\\nalso\\nused\\nin\\nthe\\n3-day\\nDI,\\nwas\\nsupplemented for this experiment with new graphs that allow\\nus to assess the degree of support from communication with the\\ncrew and a sense of association with it. This change was dictated\\nby the fact that in the isolation experiments, contrary to dry\\nimmersion, participants have contacts not only with the\\nrepresentatives of the duty teams but also within the crew\\n(Sholcova et al., 2021). To study the social interactions in the\\ncrew and the cohesion of the crew, we applied a method for\\ndiagnosing the value-oriented unity of the group.\\nFor statistical analysis in these model studies, we used the\\nsame methods as in the dry immersion model experiment.\\nResults.\\nUndercrowding\\nconditions,\\nthe\\nindicator\\n“extraversion” obtained using KTS had a positive stable\\ncorrelation with the indicator of support from communication\\n(i.e., social support) with the duty crew (p = 0.896, p < 0.05), and\\nthe indicator “introversion” had a negative relationship with the\\nsame parameter (p = -0.896, p <0.05)—according to the\\nquestionnaire\\n“psychological\\nsupport.”\\nThus,\\nit\\ncan\\nbe\\nassumed that the extroverted crew members subjectively\\nexperienced a higher level of support from communication\\n(which\\ncorresponds\\nto\\nsuch\\nan\\nevent\\nof\\n“classical”\\npsychological\\nsupport\\nas\\nthe\\norganization\\nof\\nprivate\\ncommunication channels) than from instrumental methods of\\npsychological support.\\nBy analyzing the data of the Keirsey test, it was found that\\npersons with a tendency to introversion, who did not feel unity\\nwith the crew and the need to communicate with the duty crew,\\nwere more susceptible to psychological support using virtual\\nreality technology. The indicator “extraversion” obtained using\\nthe Keirsey questionnaire had a positive stable correlation with\\nthe indicator of support from communication with the duty crew\\n(r = 0.896, p < 0.05), and the indicator “introversion” had a\\nnegative relationship with the same parameter (r = -0.896, p <\\n0.05). It should also be noted that the average values of\\ncommunication positively correlated with both the degree of\\nassociation of the subjects with the crew (perception of\\nthemselves as part of the group) and the level of support (r =\\n0.888, p < 0.05 and r = 0.858, p < 0.05, respectively). In addition, it\\nwas shown that the indicator of the need for generalization and\\ninterpretation of information correlated negatively with support\\nfrom BP (r = - 0.858, p < 0.05). In addition to the indicator of\\nintroversion, the indicator of the need for speciﬁc information\\n(sensation index according to Keirsey) positively correlated with\\nthe need for PS based on VR (r = 0.888, p < 0.05). Thus, it can be\\nassumed that introverted crew members had a higher expressed\\nneed for such an instrumental form of psychological support as\\nVR. The facial expression analysis also showed a reduction of the\\nemotion of anger after the session in all subjects (T = -1,78,\\np = 0,89)).\\nA positive two-way correlation was also established between\\nphoto support and sympathy for the duty crew (r = 0.852, p <\\n0.05) and between photo support and reading support (r = 0.865,\\np < 0.05). We assume that under the conditions of narrowing the\\ncircle of social contacts inherent in isolation, such types of\\ncontent as photos and books performed a socially substitutive\\nrole in the surveyed.\\nActigraphy data indicate a deterioration in the quality of\\nsleep in isolation. In all the subjects, except one, the duration of\\nsleep steadily decreased during the experiment. All subjects,\\nexcept one, had a tendency to decrease the time spent in bed\\nduring the night hours allotted for sleep, while all subjects, except\\ntwo, had an increase in the number of night awakenings.\\nAccording to actigraphy data, the use of psychological support\\nusing VR technologies could cause a decrease in the number of\\nnocturnal awakenings (by 1.3–1.4 times compared to the average\\nvalue for the experiment) and an increase in sleep duration (by\\n10–13.3% relative to the average value for the experiment).\\nLimitations of the study\\nAs we have already pointed out, these models are quite\\ncorrelated with a wide range of medical problems faced by\\nphysicians and clinical psychologists on Earth. But signiﬁcant\\nlimitations of this study are associated with the small sample\\nsize and short duration of model experiments. However, 1)\\nthis situation is typical for model experiments that are difﬁcult\\nto organize, and 2) our research is one of the ﬁrst objective\\nstudies of the psychophysiological effects of psychological\\nsupport. Previously, the effectiveness of PS was conﬁrmed\\nsolely on the basis of subjective self-reports of astronauts and\\nthe opinions of psychoneurologists supervising them during\\nthe ﬂight. Nevertheless, work in this direction continues both\\nin a number of new model experiments and in control groups.\\nAlso, the available objective scientiﬁc data presented in this\\narticle conﬁrm the effectiveness of promising types of PS\\nrelevant for implementation in healthcare. The description\\nof the planned scope of the introduction of PS methods is\\nbased on a systematic analysis of a wide range of scientiﬁc\\nliterature.\\nExpected scope of application of\\npsychological support methods\\nIt seems promising and expedient to apply psychological\\nsupport methods for orbital space ﬂights in a number of extreme\\nprofessions, whose representatives are characterized by a long\\nFrontiers in Physiology\\nfrontiersin.org\\n06\\nRozanov et al.\\n10.3389/fphys.2022.926597\\nexposure (exposure) of risk factors similar to those during space\\nﬂight. It should be noted here that these measures can be applied\\nas part of a whole set of PS for representatives of extreme\\nprofessions who have been under extreme conditions for a\\nlong time, in isolation, combined with a number of other\\nfactors, for example, crowding and monotony, or separately,\\nduring off-duty hours, to correct the negative impact of stress\\nfactors on the body and mind, for psychoprophylaxis and\\npsychohygiena.\\n1) Conditions of social isolation, sensory deprivation, and\\nmonotony\\nare\\na\\ntypical\\nset\\nof\\nunfavorable\\npsychophysiological factors accompanying the long-term\\nstay of patients in hospitals. Having been immobilized for a\\nlong time, deprived of contact with nature and mundane\\nenvironment stimuli, and with a narrowed circle of social\\ncontacts, such patients are increasingly plunged into\\ndepression and do not show active volitional efforts for\\na speedy correction. Under these conditions, the familiar\\nvisual and auditory environment reconstructed with the\\nhelp of computerized content, including virtual reality\\ntechnologies (pictures of nature, native homes, and art\\nobjects–museums\\nand\\nart\\ngalleries)\\ncan\\ncreate\\nan\\nadditional information inﬂux compensating for sensory\\ndeprivation. Thus, the detrained nervous system can\\nrestore its activity. This will have a positive effect not\\nonly\\non the\\nmood\\nbut also\\non the\\nwell-being\\nof\\nbedridden patients and stimulate the desire to return to\\na full and normal life, i.e., to recover.\\n2) Social security and patronage of the elderly and sedentary\\ndisabled are currently virtually devoid of any means of\\npsychological support. A system of psychological support\\nbased on elaborate space psychology tools and methods\\ncan be used with the participation of social security\\npersonnel. It can expand the range of services provided to\\nthe elderly and disabled and improve their life quality.\\n3) Conditions\\nof\\nprolonged\\nquarantine\\ncaused\\nby\\nthe\\nepidemiological\\nsituation,\\nwith\\nprolonged\\nstay\\nin\\nmonotonous conﬁnement and isolation conditions with\\nsocial and sensory deprivation, negatively affect the tone of\\nthe central nervous system (Li et al., 2022). Similarly to the\\nprevious set of conditions, providing quarantined people with\\nmeans of PS will favorably affect the functioning of the central\\nnervous system and compensate unfavorable effects of\\nextended sensory and social deprivation.\\n4) Autonomous performance under extreme living conditions\\n(polar wintering and remote drilling, etc.) is in many ways\\nsimilar to the conditions of long-term space ﬂight in terms\\nof a set of factors adversely affecting humans. Workers are\\naffected by the same sensory and social deprivation and\\nmonotony (Suedfeld, 2012). As a result, in particular, there\\nis an increase in depression, sleep disorders, and conﬂict\\ntension in winter quarters, which adversely affects not only\\nthe state of health but also labor productivity.\\n5) Personnel of ﬁshing vessels engaged in ﬁsh processing, which\\nis characterized by sensory “hunger,” being in crowded\\nconditions\\nand\\nextremely\\npronounced\\nmonotony\\nof\\nactivity (monotony).\\n6) Divers undergoing prolonged decompression in a pressure\\nchamber,\\nwhich\\nis\\ncharacterized\\nby\\nsensory\\nhunger,\\nmonotony,\\nthe\\ninability\\nto\\norganize\\nactive\\nforms\\nof\\nrecreation,\\ndifﬁculties\\nwith\\nstructuring\\nleisure,\\nand\\na\\ndecrease in intellectual (cognitive) abilities against the\\nbackground of natural physiological processes inherent in\\ndecompression.\\nIt should be noted here that the described measures can be\\napplied partially or as a whole complex of PS to correct the\\nnegative effects of stress factors on the body and psyche, as an\\neffective set of countermeasures.\\nThe criteria for the application (applicability) of PS methods\\nshould include:\\n1) health safety;\\n2) psychological safety—the content and the stimuli provided\\nshould not contain audiovisual stimuli that cause fear,\\nanxiety, and other negative emotions and mental states in\\nrecipients;\\n3) personiﬁcation—the content and the stimuli provided must\\nbe individually formed taking into account the personal\\ncultural needs of the recipient, as well as his current\\npsycho-emotional state;\\n4) compliance with the objective function—prevention of the\\nadverse effects of psychological factors of the altered\\nenvironment\\n(i.e.,\\nspace\\nﬂight,\\nground-based\\nmodel\\nexperiment,\\nautonomous\\nactivity\\nin\\nisolation,\\nand\\nquarantine), in which the use of the PS complex is planned.\\nIn the case of developing a set of PS measures for\\nrepresentatives of a certain type of extreme professions,\\npsychological risk factors inherent in a particular profession\\nshould\\nbe\\ntaken\\ninto\\naccount.\\nIn\\naccordance\\nwith\\nthe\\nprinciple\\nof\\ncompliance\\nwith\\nthe\\ntarget\\nfunction,\\nthe\\ndeveloped set of PS measures should include speciﬁc methods\\naimed against speciﬁc risk factors, taking into account their\\nspeciﬁc weight.\\nIn addition, it is necessary to take into account the expected\\nexposure time (exposure time) of a factor and the expected\\nduration of stay under altered, extreme living conditions. This\\nmay be, for example, due to the fact that the amount of\\nmultimedia\\ncontent\\nfor\\n“classical”\\npsychological\\nsupport\\nshould be determined in such a way that it is enough for\\npersons undergoing psychological support for the duration of\\nthe\\nentire\\nisolation\\nwithout\\nthe\\ndevelopment\\nof\\nsuch\\neffect—when users are bored by the PS method or content\\nFrontiers in Physiology\\nfrontiersin.org\\n07\\nRozanov et al.\\n10.3389/fphys.2022.926597\\nprovided via PS session. For example, VR in dry immersion,\\naccording to the data presented previously, served as an effective\\ncountermeasure against sensory hunger. However, it is obvious\\nthat the provided set of relaxation videos will not be enough for\\nlong-term isolation, since the video repertoire was prepared with\\nthe expectation of an experiment duration of 3 days. At the same\\ntime, the available literature data on the group dynamics of\\npsychophysiological indicators of persons in isolation should also\\nbe followed. These data can serve as a kind of predictive model.\\nFor example, a period of 3–14 days can be characterized as a\\nperiod of acute adaptation to extreme, unusual, altered living\\nconditions.\\nAlso,\\nthanks\\nto\\nthe\\nexperience\\nof\\nisolation\\nexperiments, the so-called phenomenon of the third quarter\\nhas become well known—increasing asthenization, conﬂicts\\nwithin the crew, and a decrease in motivation to perform a\\nﬂight task, combined with a loss of interest in interacting with\\nexternal subscribers, which falls precisely on the third quarter of\\nisolation (accordingly, having this information when planning a\\nset of PS measures, for example, for a remote expedition, it is\\npossible to work out a proactive set of measures timed precisely\\nto the third of the expedition period).\\nIt is necessary to take into account not only the totality and\\npeculiarity of risk factors and the gender and cultural\\ncharacteristics of the representatives of the small group for\\nwhich the PS complex is being developed but also technical\\nfeatures, primarily related to the habitable volume of the small\\ngroup’s\\nplace\\nof\\nresidence\\nand\\nthe\\nbandwidth\\nof\\ncommunication\\nchannels.\\nIt\\nis\\nobvious\\nthat\\nan\\nacute\\nshortage of habitable volume will make it impossible to\\napply recommendations on active forms of leisure and\\nsports for psychological recreation (this was modeled in the\\nESKIS experiment, and active games in a virtual reality\\nenvironment served as a countermeasure to such an acute\\nshortage\\nof\\nmotor\\nactivity).\\nIf\\nthere\\nare\\nsigniﬁcant\\ncommunication delays, irregular communication sessions,\\nand low bandwidth of information exchange channels, it is\\nnecessary to take into account the complex of psychological\\nsupport methods being developed for interplanetary ﬂights\\nand adopt from it a number of methods applicable under\\nconditions of increased autonomy.\\nConclusion\\nDuring two simulated studies, a new hardware and software\\ncomplex developed for providing PS sessions underwent medical\\ntesting within the framework of the activities of the Pavlov Center\\nfor Integrative Physiology for Medicine, High-tech Healthcare,\\nand\\nStress\\nTolerance\\nTechnologies.\\nObserved\\npsychophysiological changes in the psychophysiological status\\nof subjects under stressful conditions allow us to state that PS\\nmeasures, elaborated for the needs of space medicine, effectively\\nprovide psychological support for the people experiencing\\nprolonged stress, caused by conﬁnement, sensory deprivation,\\nmonotony, and social isolation.

            "Astronauts face several psychological challenges during long-duration space missions, which can potentially lead to psychological problems. \n",
            "\n",
            "1. Physical Factors: Microgravity can impact cell structure and differentiation, as well as the immune and central nervous system. The central nervous system needs to adapt to microgravity since different somatosensory, visual, and vestibular information need to be processed. Space radiation also represents a risk during space missions, leading to several changes in the central nervous system, like shifts in brain fluids, altered sensory perception, and neurovestibular problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Habitability: Factors of \"habitability\", referring to the main characteristics of the spacecraft, can contribute to the overall well-being of astronauts. These include light, noise, vibration, and temperature. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. Individual Issues: Isolation from family, friends, and life on Earth, coupled with hard work continuously monitored, can lead to potential psychological distress. Memory and concentration deficits may occur, along with an increase in the likelihood of making errors and a decrease in reaction times.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Interpersonal Issues: The mental well-being of an astronaut can be affected by factors related to the relationships with other crew members, especially when they are heterogeneous. These may provoke tension, loosen the team cohesion, and create a competitive environment and uncertainty regarding individual roles.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Psychopathological Issues: Loss of or reduced sleep quality is a critical issue among astronauts, as it may provoke fatigue, concentration problems, and possible drop in overall performance levels. Other issues include personality changes, depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosomatic symptoms, neurovestibular problems, alterations in cognitive function, and sensory perception. \n",
            "\n",
            "6. Post-Mission Issues: The return to Earth can be stressful and demanding for reasons such as re-joining an open society and to the family after a period in a small environment. The first few weeks after returning to Earth represent a particularly critical period in which negative effects on mood and performance can be expected.\n"
